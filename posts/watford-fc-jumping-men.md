## The challenge

A petition was started to bring the famous 80's 'Jumping Men' animation back to the scoreboard at Vicarage Road so I decided to create a new digital version. They made their official return in August 2012 as Watford beat Birmingham City 2-0.

{% imageTest "./img/watford-fc-80s-scoreboard.jpg", "Watford FC scoreboard from the 80's", "1200" %}

## The outcome

<div style="padding:56% 0 0 0;position:relative;max-width:100%;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/157342169?autoplay=1&loop=1&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
