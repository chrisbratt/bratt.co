## My role

My role as the UX/UI Designer included discovery research, journey mapping, feature mapping, prototyping, user testing and UI design.

## The challenge

John Lewis were in the process of launching a new mobile-first, responsive website and were beginning to direct customers to the new website. The new website didn't have Wish List functionality. We had 8 weeks to design and implement a new mobile-first responsive Wish List before 100% of traffic was being directed to the new website. We also needed to ensure that the designs would work with the upcoming rebrand.

## The goal

Create a simplified, lovable and complete Wish List experience that supports the wants and needs of our Best Customers.

## The process

### The status quo

The ultimate goal was to achieve feature parity. The two main constraints that we had were time (we didn't have much) and technology (limited scope to change the backend). With that in mind we began by understanding how the current Wish List worked, from both a user experience and technology point of view.

### User flows

Using OmniGraffle I put together user flows to visualise how the current Wish List worked.

### User wants and needs

We gathered insights from the data team and held focus groups to understand who the users were and what purpose the Wish List served.

We discovered early on that Wish List was used by a small percentage of users, however, they were predominantly our Best Customers. We also found out that although customers could create up to 5 Wish Lists, around 90% of those that used the feature only had a single Wish List. We discussed a concept of merging customers' Wish Lists into a single Wish List with the ability to 'tag' items, however, this felt like too much of a departure from the original goal.

* Who?
  * Best Customers
  * Great Customers
  * In-Store Partners
* Why?
  * Researching and shortlisting
  * Shopping for me
  * Shopping for someone else
  * Gifting
* When?
  * Day to day
  * Special occasions
  * Seasonal
  * Bargain hunting
  * Gift list
  * In-store services (e.g. Personal Styling)
  * Out of stock items

### Customer feedback

We gathered feedback that had been submitted by customers regarding Wish List and categorised the comments. 54% were about the disappearance of Wish List, 27% were feature ideas, 19% were defects/usability issues.

"I had stored a number of wish lists with various ideas as we undertake a large building project."

"I was shopping and wanted to put items into my wish list and it wasn’t there. One of the best features was wish list. Please don't get rid of it!"

"I can’t find a wish list option which is annoying given the time of year!"

"Where is my wish list? I like to browse and put things by for further discussion with household. Very annoying."

"What the f*** have you done? I use the wish list for work!"

### Weekly goals

We set weekly goals to ensure we were making improvements to the user experience and continuously adding value. Because of the feedback we had received, we decided to add a navigation link and redirect customers back to the old Wish List using a strangulation method. This ensured those that wanted to use their Wish List at very least had access to it.

The second goal was to create a 'view only' Wish List. This meant customers that had already created and added items to a Wish List could now view the items and purchase them. However, many features such as 'stock' and 'Add to basket' were missing at this point (but customers could click through and find this information).

The third goal was to allow customers to start adding and removing items from their existing Wish Lists.

From then on we started implementing the remaining features including stock status, add to basket, create Wish List, rename Wish List and delete Wish Lists.

## The outcome

We launched the new responsive Wish List within 8 weeks and achieved the level of feature parity we set out to reach plus made some significant UX improvements, including significantly simplifying the experience for the ~90% of customers that have a single Wish List.

Of those customers using the new Wish List we saw a significant increase in the number of items they were adding to Wish Lists vs the old Wish List.
