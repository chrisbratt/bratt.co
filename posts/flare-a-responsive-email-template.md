Whilst at graze I was finding myself often having to help the marketing team build emails - so I decided to build a reusable template file that they could use to build out the emails themselves. The template file used content blocks that could be easily copied into their email.

The template was tested using Litmus to ensure it was compatible with all of the most popular email clients.
