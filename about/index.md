<h1>Hi, I'm<br>{{ metadata.name }}</h1>

<p class="bump">15 years experience designing digital products. {{ content.elevator }}.</p>

I'm currently working as Lead Product Designer at giffgaff.

After graduating from Portsmouth University with a degree in Interactive Media Design I freelanced in web design and video production. I regularly filmed and edited videos of nightclub events and in 2009 filmed Pete Tong backstage at Creamfields.

I'm a husband and a dad. My main interests include photography, film, music and football. I enjoy filmmaking and have directed three short films and a music video for a local band.
